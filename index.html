  <h1>ðŸ’Œ To My Person â€” Since 14th April 2023</h1>

  <p>
    Hey love,<br><br>
    I donâ€™t even know how to put this into words, but Iâ€™ll try anyway, because you deserve that and so much more.  
    Itâ€™s been over a year now â€” since that 14th April 2023, the day everything changed.  
    Even though life hasn't always been easy, having you beside me has made it all so beautiful, comforting, and real.  
    Youâ€™ve become home to me â€” not a place, but a person.<br><br>

    Please donâ€™t ever think youâ€™re behind. Youâ€™re not. Life isnâ€™t a race â€” itâ€™s a journey, and youâ€™re walking it with grace.  
    Youâ€™re allowed to take your time, to figure things out, to fail and try again. Just donâ€™t stop. Ever.  
    Because I know you're capable of building something extraordinary â€” whether itâ€™s a career that fulfills you or a life that feels peaceful.<br><br>

    As for us, I don't know what the future holds â€” no one ever does.  
    But I do know this: I hope you enjoy every moment, if not with me, enjoy with others.<br><br>

    Thank you for loving me the way you do â€” in your quiet ways, your loud laughter, your thoughtful gestures.  
    Thank you for staying. Thank you for being mine.  
    Iâ€™m rooting for you â€” always. In your career, your goals, your healing, and your happiness.<br><br>

    With all my heart,<br>
    Kashish
  </p>
