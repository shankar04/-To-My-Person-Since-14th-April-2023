ðŸ’Œ To My Person â€” Since 14th April 2023
Hey love,
I donâ€™t even know how to put this into words, but Iâ€™ll try anyway, because you deserve that and so much more
Itâ€™s been over a year now â€” since that 14th April 2023, the day everything changed. And even though life hasn't always been easy, having you beside me has made it all so beautiful, comforting, and real. Youâ€™ve become home to me â€” not a place, but a person.
Please donâ€™t ever think youâ€™re behind. Youâ€™re not. Life isnâ€™t a race â€” itâ€™s a journey, and youâ€™re walking it with grace. Youâ€™re allowed to take your time, to figure things out, to fail and try again. Just donâ€™t stop. Ever. Because I know you're capable of building something extraordinary â€” whether itâ€™s a career that fulfills you or a life that feels peaceful.
As for us, I don't know what the future holds â€” no one ever does. But I do know this: I hope you enjoy every moment, if not with me, enjoy with others.
Thank you for loving me the way you do â€” in your quiet ways, your loud laughter, your thoughtful gestures. Thank you for staying. Thank you for being mine.
Iâ€™m rooting for you â€” always. In your career, your goals, your healing, and your happiness.
With all my heart.
